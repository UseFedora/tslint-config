# Teachable TSLint Config

This is a shared configuration of TSLint for Teachable apps. We'll publish this on npm soon, but for now add this line to your package.json:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@teachable/tslint-config": "UseFedora/tslint-config"
}
```

Here's the syntax for your tslint.json file:

```json
{
    "extends": "@teachable/tslint-config"
}
```
